----- Editorial Rule -----
* when in doubt, use google/yahoo search to confirm the rarity of the phrases
  for example search: "一瞻丰采" site:.tw
  - if the amount of the results is under 1000, it's likely okay to remove this
    phrase
  - if tsi.src variants showed up in the first page of the results, you should
    remove this phrase. Tsi.src variants include SEO sites, this phenomenom is
    quite amazing itself.
  - for idioms, it's possible the first hit is the idiom database, it's up to 
    the editor to decide.
  - if this candidate is apparent part of a long phrase and the segmentation is
    apparently incorrect, find a way to remove the phrase candidate and replace
    it with the complete one, but forget about it if the length is longer than
    6.
* We need to constantly remind ourself, IME is not an idiom database.
