    # Note: For pull requests from forks, this workflow requires manual approval
    # by a repository maintainer before it will run. This is a security measure
    # to prevent malicious actors from accessing repository secrets.
    #
    # To enable fork PR reviews:
    # 1. Go to Settings → Actions → General
    # 2. Under "Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators"
    # 3. Select "Require approval for all outside collaborators"
    #
    # Maintainers: Review the PR code first, then approve the workflow run if safe.
