    # Note: This workflow skips when modifying itself to avoid OIDC token validation errors.
    # GitHub's security model requires workflow files using id-token: write to be identical
    # to the version on the master branch. PRs that modify workflows cannot pass OIDC
    # validation until merged. This is intentional security and cannot be bypassed.
    # Workflow changes should be manually reviewed and will apply to future PRs after merge.
    #
    # Optional: Only run on specific file changes
    # paths:
    #   - "src/**/*.ts"
    #   - "src/**/*.tsx"
    #   - "src/**/*.js"
    #   - "src/**/*.jsx"

    # Note: Fork PRs are automatically skipped because they cannot access repository
    # secrets (CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN) or generate OIDC tokens. This is GitHub's
    # security model and cannot be overridden.
    #
    # For fork PRs, maintainers can:
    # 1. Merge the PR first, then Claude will review on the next PR
    # 2. Use the on-demand claude.yml workflow by commenting @claude on the PR
    # 3. Manually review the code
    #
    # This workflow only runs on PRs from branches within this repository.
